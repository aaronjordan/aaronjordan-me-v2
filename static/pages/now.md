# What I'm Up to Now

I'm in Austin, Texas, enjoying my collegiate dream job from this beautiful *but 
dreadfully hot* place, surrounded by exceptional people that inspire me to
enjoy, learn, and celebrate every day. My goal moving forward is to continue
steadily improving â€” both as a software engineer and as an individual. I hope
(and often find) that each day, I learn something meaningful from the last.

To support that goal, this is what I spend my time doing:


* Enjoying the moments I get to spend with my wife Mazlin, choosing quality time with her over just about anything.
* Delivering great software at Google, learning all that I can from the talented people and great opportunity around me.
* Spending time with my favorite underdog, Trout, who keeps me entertained.
* Delighting in the latest Formula One news and coverage.
* Testing my own ability to race with my iRacing sim and rental karting.
* Getting together with friends to enjoy what the city of Austin has to offer.
* Playing and listening to music to express myself and keep my sanity.
* (And of course) catching every release from Marvel or Wes Anderson on opening weekend.

**These are my main priorities right now.** I'm always open to exploring new things and ideas, but I stick to this list about 80% of the time. These are the things that are most important to me.

  As my priorities change and come into focus, I try to remember to update this list.<br/>
