I've been able to experience the benefits and challenges presented by Google's tremendous scale of operations. The most delightful part of the role has been creating new and creative sharable utilities for internal users across projects using AngularDart frontend libraries.",

			"body": "On my first project at General Motors, I contributed to the rewrite of the Accessories e-commerce application. As a team, we delivered a more modern and snappy user interfance to enhance the experience both for customers and retailers (dealers) for aftersale items. Most of my work pertained to the internal application used to process orders by dealers and distribution centers. The project helped me build an understanding of how to build software that scales well, both in the sense of it being a large codebase and it having large user base. In addition, I reached a deep understanding of JavaScript through the process, at one point even implementing my own XLSX (Microsoft Excel File) writer in the language.",

Most of the site is built on a React/NodeJS/Express platform, similar to this site. It included a few key components: a secure RSVP section powered by OAuth (Google/Facebook) sign-in, a self-hosted livestream for my out-of-state family to stream the event, sections for our Target registry as well as hotel information, and \u2014 of course \u2014 many photos from all stages of our relationship! The areas of the site which are still relevant are still accessible today, with all of our wedding photos added to the photo gallery.",

There, coaches can easily find up-to-date content to help them lead others, a process which before was a mess of Google Drive sharing and outdated local PDFs. As I have limited access to the backend, I have used JQuery and CSS to generate and manipulate DOM elements to provide new layouts and functionality.",

The backend server runs on Node.js with Express and Mailgun, which are the only dependencies of the project. The only external script loaded by the client is Font Awesome's CDN.",

Having a background in audio engineering and interest in digital signal processing, the topic of filtering was an exciting choice. I used a Terasic DE-10 Standard and some starter code on Github, which I mapped from the DE-2 to the DE-10 and filtered several audio samples through. Analysis of the harmonic texture of the filtered output is discussed in the report.",
